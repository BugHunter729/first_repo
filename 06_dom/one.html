<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a structured way for web browsers to represent and interact with HTML pages, treating every part of a page (like tags, text, and attributes) as objects.(It's how JavaScript “talks” to HTML.)
The DOM is explained as a model that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects (head, body, p, img ). Every element, attribute, and text is considered a "node" in this tree

    Example HTML:
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>Paragraph</p>
    </body>
    </html>

    Corresponding DOM Tree:

    Document
    └── html
        └── body
            ├── h1
            │    └── "Hello"
            └── p
                └── "Paragraph"

# Window and Document :-
-The browser creates a window object that represents the browser tab or window.
-window contains many properties and methods — one of them is document.
-The document object represents the webpage and provides access to:
    HTML elements.
    Document structure.
    Methods for DOM manipulation.

    console.log(window.document); // Outputs the entire HTML document and methods for manipulation
    console.log(document); //outputs entire document
    console.dir(windows); //Outputs the entire HTML document and methods for manipulation


!! Collections like HTMLCollection or NodeList are used to handle groups of elements, but they differ from standard arrays. -->

<!-- 
1:27 -  how to add content
difference between  textContent and innerText
textContent => to show all the texts even if it is hidden due todisplay property or  css property
innerText => to show what is visible in on the page
innerHTML => to show  html values(tag, attribute, text)

16:20 -  query selector
only returns the first element that matches the specified selectors.

23:15 - query selector all
returns all node list that matches the selectors -->
