//A singleton object in JavaScript is an object that is created only once and provides a single shared instance 
// throughout the program, usually created using object literals like const obj = { key: "value" };.
//This object singleton has only one instance â€” reused wherever it's referenced.

//Multiple instances in JavaScript are created using constructor functions or classes with the new keyword, 
// allowing each object to have its own separate copy of properties and methods.

//Object literals
