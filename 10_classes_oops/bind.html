<!-- let me explain if anybody has some confusion so remeber this line ""When used in event handlers, this refers to the element that triggered the event.""  so here eventhough we create an instance of react class using new keyword and store that new created object in the app variable then that object is having server and library properties and handleClick() fn but when when we are calling the fn handle click inside addEventListener() then what happen is actually the element button is calling the function handleClick() so here this refers to the button element not the context of object created using class React so here It is priniting <button>...</button > but when we use bind() then we are actually binding the context of the object created using class React. -->
